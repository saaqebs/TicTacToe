# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project utilizes [PennDraw.java](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/current/PennDraw.java), a Java file 
from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/)'s website.

A basic Tic Tac Toe program that is executable from the command prompt or terminal window after compilation. 
Let's the users play as many rounds as they would like.
